Profanity filter

The bot's profanity filter contains over 900+ blacklisted bad words with them covering over 20k+ modified spellings(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet). Due to security reasons, 
all the blacklisted words cannot be shared here.

If ``merry`` is a blacklisted word, the word ``m33ry`` will also be blacklisted because the number 3 would be substituted for the letter E.

**Profanity Filter Settings**

1. ``profanity_whitelisted_users``: White listed users from the profanity filter. Defualt value: none.
2. ``profanity_whitelisted_roles``: White listed roles from the profanity filter. Defualt value: none.
3. ``profanity_whitelisted_channels``: White listed channels from the profanity filter. Defualt value: none.

**Note: Any user with `manage_messages` permission will automatically be whitelisted from the filter.**
